customers to decrease their time spent waiting in line for the 
park rides.  The seven Outstanding solution papers will be 
published in The UMAP Journal, along with commentary from 
the authors and other judges.  All 599 of the competing teams 
are to be congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm 
for mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary problem 
solving.  This year’s judges remarked that the quality of the 
modeling and presentation in the papers was extremely high, 
making it difficult to select just seven Outstanding papers. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 20th annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 599 
teams representing institutions from 11 countries participated in 
the contest. Seven teams from the following six institutions 
were designated as OUTSTANDING: 
 
 Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 
 Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA 
 Merton College, Oxford University, Oxford UK 
 University College Cork, Cork, Ireland 
 University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO (2 Teams) 
 University of Washington, Seattle, WA 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 5 to Monday, 
February 9, 2004.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 
2004 MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem and 
data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year, the two MCM problems were particularly 
challenging.  Problem A asked teams to develop a model to 
address the issue of the uniqueness of human thumbprints. 
Problem B asked teams to propose and test schemes for a 
QuickPass system in an amusement park that allowed 
 
 
To obtain additional information about the MCM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the MCM 
Website at:  www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm, or contact COMAP at: mcm@comap.com. 
 
Major  funding for  the MCM  is provided by a grant  from  the National Security Agency and support  from COMAP. Additional support 
is  provided  by  the  Institute  for Operations Research  and  the Management  Sciences  (INFORMS). COMAP's Mathematical Contest  in 
Modeling  and  Interdisciplinary Contest  in Modeling  are unique  among modeling  competitions  in  that  they  are  the only  international 
contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP 
uses  mathematical  tools  to  explore  real-world  problems.  It  serves  the  educational  community  as  well  as  the  world  of  work  by 
preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
