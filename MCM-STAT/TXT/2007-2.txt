2007 ICM Statistics 
 

This problem also had the ever-present requirements in the 
ICM to use thorough data analysis, creativity, approximation 
and precision, along with effective communication.  The author 
of the problem was Paul Campbell, Beloit College.  The 
problem originated from his interest in coordinating multiple 
transplants.  The four Outstanding solution papers will be 
published in The UMAP Journal, along with commentaries 
from the problem author and judges.  All the members of the 
273 competing teams are to be congratulated for their excellent 
work and enthusiasm for scientific and mathematical modeling 
and interdisciplinary problem solving.  This year’s judges 
remarked that despite the challenging problem with myriad 
difficult tasks, the quality of the modeling, analysis, and 
presentation was high. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 9th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year, a 
record 273 teams representing institutions from five countries 
participated in the contest.  Two teams were designated as 
OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
  
Duke University, Durham, NC 
Princeton University, Princeton, NJ    (INFORMS Prize) 
 
 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 8 to Monday, 
February 12, 2007.  During that time, teams of three students 
researched, analyzed, modeled, and communicated a solution to 
an open-ended interdisciplinary modeling problem. The 2007 
ICM was primarily an on-line contest, where teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem 
statement and data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s 
ICM Website.  
 
This year’s organ transplant problem was particularly 
challenging.  It required teams to understand the science and 
management of organ transplantation and to model the policy 
issues associated with improving the efficiency of the US organ 
transplantation network.  The problem contained many issues 
such as, medical, political, social, cultural, psychological, and 
ethical to be analyzed, and had several challenging 
requirements needing scientific and mathematical modeling and 
analysis.   
 
 
ICM is associated with COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend.  ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), 
as well as competence in written communication.  The first four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from environmental 
science, environmental engineering, biology, chemistry, and/or resource management.  The next three ICM problems involved 
operations research, information science, environmental science, and interdisciplinary issues in security and safety.  This is the second 
contest problem involving public health. Each team is expected to have advisors and team members who represent a range of 
disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling.  Next year, the ICM problem will continue to involve modeling in the 
area of public health. 
 
To obtain additional information about the ICM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the ICM 
Website at:  www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/icm, or contact John Tomicek, Contest Coordinator, at: MCM@comap.com. 
 
Major start-up funding for the ICM was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (through Project INTERMATH) 
and COMAP. Additional support is provided by The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) 
and IBM.  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling 
competitions in that they are the only international contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its 
educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses mathematical tools to explore real-world problems. It serves the 
educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, 
consumers, workers, and community leaders.
