This problem also had the ever-present ICM requirements to 
use data analysis and creativity along with effective 
communication. The author of the problem was Miriam 
Goldstein, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, CA, and the 
problem originated from her own professional research. 
 
The Four Outstanding solution papers will be published in The 
UMAP Journal, along with commentaries from the problem 
author and judges. All the members of the 356 competing teams 
are to be congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm 
for scientific and mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary 
problem solving. This year’s judges remarked that despite the 
challenging problem with myriad difficult tasks, the quality of 
the modeling, analysis, and presentation was high. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 12th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year 356 
teams representing institutions from four countries participated 
in the contest. Four teams were designated as OUTSTANDING 
WINNERS: 
  
Carroll College, Helena, MT (INFORMS Prize) 
Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China 
Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China 
Lawrence University, Appleton, WI  
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 18 to Monday, 
February 22, 2010. During that time, teams of three students 
researched, analyzed, modeled, and communicated a solution to 
an open-ended interdisciplinary modeling problem. The 2010 
ICM was primarily an online contest, where teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem 
statement and data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s 
ICM Website.  
 
This year’s environmental sciences problem was extremely 
complex and challenging. It required teams to make decisions 
on challenges in areas of physical oceanography, marine 
ecology, and environmental modeling. Teams were required to 
build effective models to confront these challenging issues and 
understand the complexity of pollution in the oceans. The 
problem contained many complex and multifaceted issues to be 
analyzed and had several challenging requirements calling for 
innovative scientific and mathematical modeling and analysis.  
 
 
ICM is associated with COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend. ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), 
as well as competence in written communication. The first four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from environmental 
science, biology, chemistry, and/or resource management. The next three ICM problems involved operations research, information 
science, environmental science, and interdisciplinary issues in security and safety. The next three contest problems involved public 
health. This year’s problem returned to the environmental area.  Each team is expected to include advisors and team members who 
represent a range of disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling. 
 
To obtain additional information about the ICM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the ICM 
Website at: www.mcmcontest.com, or contact COMAP at: mcm@comap.com 
 
Major start-up funding for the ICM was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (through Project INTERMATH) 
and COMAP. Additional support is provided by The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) 
and IBM.  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling 
competitions in that they are the only international contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its 
educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses mathematical tools to explore real-world problems. It serves the 
educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, 
consumers, workers, and community leaders.
