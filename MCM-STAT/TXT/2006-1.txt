2006 Mathematical Contest in Modeling 
Press Release—March 20, 2006 

teams to consider both the hydrodynamics and the practical 
aspects of the problem. Problem B required teams to construct 
a model capable of assisting a hypothetical airline company 
needing to determine an efficient way of positioning 
wheelchairs in order to assist limited mobility passenger travel 
at a spectrum of airport terminals. Teams selecting this problem 
were also required to craft their presentations as proposals that 
considered the intrinsic costs associated with their approach and 
how these costs influence their proposed solutions.  
The twelve Outstanding solution papers will be published in 
The UMAP Journal, along with commentary from the authors 
and other judges.  All 748 of the competing teams are to be 
congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm for 
mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary problem solving.   
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 22nd annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 748 
teams representing institutions from 9 countries participated in 
the contest. Eleven teams from the following ten institutions 
were designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Carroll College, Helena MT 
Duke University, Durham, NC 
Harvard University, Cambridge, MA (2 Teams) 
MIT, Cambridge, MA 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst, Troy, NY 
Rice University, Houston, TX 
Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China 
University of California at Davis, CA 
University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 
Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 2 to Monday, 
February 6, 2006.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 
2006 MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem and 
data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year, the two MCM problems represented significant 
challenges. The author of both problems, Professor Kelly Black 
of Union College was also a member of the panel of final 
judges.   Problem A asked teams to develop a model for 
determining a water irrigation schedule for a field of fixed 
dimensions subject to a collection of requirements that forced

Major  funding  for  the  MCM  is  provided  COMAP.  Additional  support  is  provided  by  the  Institute  for  Operations  Research  and  the 
Management Sciences  (INFORMS),  and Two Sigma  Investments. COMAP's Mathematical Contest  in Modeling and  Interdisciplinary 
Contest  in Modeling are unique among modeling competitions  in  that  they are  the only  international contests  in which  students work 
in  teams  to  find  a  solution.  Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on  mathematical  modeling,  COMAP  uses  mathematical  tools  to 
explore real-world problems. It serves the educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better 
informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers. 
 

748 teams participated  
10 high school teams (1%) 
247 U.S. Teams (33%)  
501 Foreign Teams (67%) from Australia, Canada, Finland, 
Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, China, South
