communication. The author of the problem was Heide Williams  
Ph.D. student in Economics at Harvard University, who served 
on the panel of final judges.  The problem originated from her 
study and research in funding for child vaccinations.  The four 
outstanding solution papers will be published in The UMAP 
Journal, along with commentaries from the problem author and 
judges.  All the members of the 224 competing teams are to be 
congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm for 
scientific and mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary 
problem solving.  This year’s judges remarked that despite the 
challenging problem, the quality of the modeling, analysis, and 
presentation was extremely high and the award levels reflected 
this increase in quality. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 8th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year, 224 
teams representing institutions from six countries participated 
in the contest. 4  teams from the following three institutions 
were designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
  
Duke University, Durham, NC (2 Teams) INFORMS Prize 
Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA 
United States Military Academy, West Point, NY 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 2 to Monday, 
February 6, 2006. During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, analyzed, 
modeled, and communicated a solution to an open-ended 
interdisciplinary modeling problem. The 2006 ICM was 
primarily an online contest, where teams registered, obtained 
contest materials, and downloaded the problem statement and 
data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s ICM Website.  
 
This year’s public health problem was particularly challenging.  
It required teams to understand the science of the HIV virus and 
understand and model the financial and policy issues associated 
with controlling the pandemic.  The problem contained issues 
such as economic, demographic, political, environmental, 
social, psychological, geographic, and science, had several 
challenging requirements needing scientific and mathematical 
modeling and analysis, and also had the ever-present 
requirements in the ICM to use thorough data analysis, 
creativity, approximation, precision, and effective 
 
ICM is an extension of COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend.  ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills as well as competence in written communication.  The first 
four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from environmental science, environmental engineering, biology, chemistry, and/or 
resource management.  The next three ICM problems involved operations research, information science, environmental science, and 
interdisciplinary issues in security and safety.  This is the first of the series contest problems involving public health. Each team is 
expected to have advisors and team members who represent a range of disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling.  
Next year, the ICM problem will continue to involve modeling in the area of public health. 
 
To obtain additional information about the ICM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the ICM website 
at:  www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/icm, or contact COMAP at: icm@comap.com 
 
Major start-up funding for the ICM was provided by COMAP. Additional support is provided by The Institute for Operations 
Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS, Two Sigma Investment, and IBM.  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling 
and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling competitions in that they are the only international contests in 
which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses 
mathematical tools to explore real-world problems. It serves the educational community as well as the world of work by preparing 
students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, workers, and community leaders.
