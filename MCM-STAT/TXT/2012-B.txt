2012 Mathematical Contest in Modeling® 
Press Release—April 6, 2012 

 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 28th annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 3697 teams 
representing institutions from seventeen countries participated in 
the contest. Ten teams from the following institutions were 
designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Bethel University, Arden Hills, MN 
Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong 
National University of Singapore, Singapore 
 
Peking University, Beijing, China 
Shanghai Foreign Language School, Shanghai, China 
University of Colorado, Boulder, CO (2) 
University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 
Western Washington University, Bellingham, WA 
Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 9 to Monday, 
February 13, 2011.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 2012 
MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, obtained 
contest materials, and downloaded the problem and data at the 
prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year the two MCM problems represented significant challenges.  The 
author or Problem A is Lee Zia.  "How  much  do  the  leaves  on  a  tree 
weigh?''  How  might  one  estimate  the  actual  weight  of  the  leaves  (or  for 
that matter  any other  parts  of  the  tree)?  How  might  one  classify  leaves? 
Build  a mathematical model  to  describe  and classify  leaves. Consider  and 
answer  the  following:  Why do  leaves have  the  various  shapes  that  they 
have?  Do  the shapes  "minimize" overlapping individual  shadows  that 
are  cast,  so  as  to maximize  exposure?  Does  the distribution  of  leaves 
within  the "volume" of  the  tree  and  its branches  effect  the  shape? Is leaf 
shape  (general  characteristics)  related  to  tree  profile/branching structure? 
How  would  you  estimate  the  leaf  mass  of  a  tree?  Is there  a correlation 
between  the  leaf  mass  and  the  size characteristics  of  the  tree  (height, 
mass,  volume  defined  by the  profile)? In addition  to your  one  page 
summary  sheet  prepare  a one  page  letter  to  an  editor  of  a scientific 
journal  outlining your  key findings. 
 
Problem B was written by Catherine Roberts, and required contestants 
to analyze boat and camping trips down the Big Long River. Visitors  to 
the  Big Long  River  (225  miles)  can  enjoy  scenic views  and  exciting 
white  water  rapids. The river  is inaccessible to  hikers,  so  the  only 
way  to  enjoy  it  is  to  take  a  river  trip  that  requires  several days of 
camping.  River trips  all  start  at  First  Launch and  exit  the  river  at 

Final Exit, 225  miles  downstream. Passengers  take  either  oar-  powered 
rubber  rafts, which  travel  on  average  4 mph  or  motorized  boats, 
which  travel  on  average  8 mph.  The  trips  range  from  6  to  18  nights 
of  camping  on  the  river, start  to finish.  The  government agency 
responsible  for  managing  this  river  wants  every  trip  to  enjoy  a 
wilderness experience, with  minimal  contact  with  other  groups  of 
boats  on  the  river.  Currently,  X trips travel  down the  Big Long River 
each  year  during  a  six month  period  (the  rest  of  the  year  it  is  too 
cold  for  river  trips). There  are  Y camp  sites  on  the  Big Long River, 
distributed fairly  uniformly  throughout the  river  corridor. Given the 
rise  in  popularity of  river  rafting,  the  park  managers  have  been  asked 
to  allow  more  trips  to travel  down  the  river.  They  want  to  determine 
how  they  might  schedule  an  optimal  mix  of  trips, of varying duration 
(measured in  nights  on  the  river)  and  propulsion  (motor or  oar)  that 
will  utilize  the campsites  in  the  best  way  possible. In other  words, 
how  many  more  boat  trips  could  be added  to  the  Big Long River's 
rafting  season? The  river  managers  have  hired  you  to  advise  them  on 
ways  in  which  to develop  the  best  schedule  and  on  ways  in  which  to 
determine  the  carrying  capacity  of  the  river, remembering  that  no 
two  sets  of  campers  can occupy  the  same  site  at  the  same  time.  In 
addition  to  your one  page  summary  sheet, prepare  a  one  page memo 
to  the  managers  of  the  river  describing  your  key findings.  
 
The ten Outstanding solution papers will be featured in The UMAP 
Journal, along with commentary from the authors and other judges. 
All 3697 of the competing teams are to be congratulated for their 
excellent work and enthusiasm for mathematical modeling and 
interdisciplinary problem solving.

Major  funding  for  the  MCM  is  provided  by  COMAP.  Additional  support  is  provided  by  the  Institute  for  Operations  Research  and  the  Management  Sciences 
(INFORMS)  and  Two  Sigma  Investments.  COMAP's  Mathematical  Contest  in  Modeling  and  Interdisciplinary  Contest  in  Modeling  are  unique  among  modeling 
competitions  in  that  they  are  the  only  international  contests  in which  students work  in  teams  to  find  a  solution. Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on mathematical 
modeling, COMAP uses mathematical  tools  to explore real-world problems. It serves  the educational community as well as  the world of work by preparing students  to 
become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
