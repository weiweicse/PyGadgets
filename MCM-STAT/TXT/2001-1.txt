2001 Mathematical Contest in Modeling 
Press Release(cid:151)March 21, 2001 
 

COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 17th Annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM)). This year, 496 
teams representing 238 institutions from 11 countries 
participated in the contest.  
 

2001 MCM OUTSTANDING WINNERS 

This year(cid:146)s Problem A was about bicycle wheels and what edge 
they may give to a race. Before any contest, professional 
cyclists make educated guesses about which one of two basic 
types of wheels to choose for any given competition.  The 
team(cid:146)s Sports Director has asked them to come up with a better 
system to help determine which kind of wheel (cid:150) wire spoke or 
solid disk (cid:150) should be used for any given race course. 
 
Problem B addressed the evacuation of Charleston, South 
Carolina during 1999(cid:146)s Hurricane Floyd.  Maps, population 
data, and other specific details were given to the teams.  They 
were tasked with constructing a model to investigate potential 
strategies.  In addition, they were asked to submit a news article 
that would be used to explain their plan to the public. 
 

 
Problem A 
•  U.S. Military Academy (NY) 
•  University Cork College (Ireland) 
•  Stellenbosch University (South Africa) 
Problem B 
•  Duke University (NC) 
•  Governor(cid:146)s School (VA) 
•  Wake Forest University (NC) 
•  Harvey Mudd College (CA) 
•  Lawrence Technological University (MI) 
•  Bethel College (MN) 
 
The 2001 MCM began at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, February 9 and 
officially ended at 11:59 p.m. on Monday, February 12, 2001. 
During that time, teams of up to three undergraduates were to 
research and submit an optimal solution for one of two open-
ended modeling problems.  The 2001 MCM marked the 
inaugural year for the new on-line contest, and it was a great 
success.  Students were able to effectively register, obtain 
contest materials, download the problems at the appropriate 
time, and enter data all through COMAP(cid:146)S MCM website.  This 
new on-line contest procedure is age and economically 
appropriate, and encourages a more efficient MCM for the 
future. 
 
In additional to MCM, COMAP also sponsors the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM), which runs concurrently with MCM.  
This contest offers a modeling problem involving concepts in mathematics, environmental science, environmental engineering, and/or 
resource management. Results of this year(cid:146)s ICM can be found on COMAP(cid:146)s website at www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/icm. 
 
To obtain additional information about the MCM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the MCM web 
site at:  www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm, or contact Clarice Callahan, Contest Coordinator, at:  
c.callahan@mail.comap.com. 
 
Major funding for the MCM is provided by a grant from the National Security Agency and COMAP. Additional support is provided by The  
Institute  for Operations  Research  and  the Management  Sciences  (INFORMS),  the  Society  for  Industrial  and Applied Mathematics  (SIAM),  and  the 
Mathematical Association of America  (MAA). COMAP’s Mathematical Contest  in Modeling  is unique among modeling competitions  in  that  it  is  the 
only  international  contest  in  which  students  work  in  teams  to  find  a  solution.  Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on  mathematical  modeling, 
COMAP  uses  mathematical  tools  to  explore  real-world  problems.  It  serves  the  educational  community  as  well  as  the  world  of  work  by  preparing 
students to become better informed(cid:151)and prepared(cid:151)citizens.
