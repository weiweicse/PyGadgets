2005 MCM Statistics 
 

B asked teams to propose a model to help determine the optimal 
number of tollbooths in a barrier-toll plaza.  The ten 
Outstanding solution papers will be published in The UMAP 
Journal, along with commentary from the authors and other 
judges.  All 644 of the competing teams are to be congratulated 
for their excellent work and enthusiasm for mathematical 
modeling and interdisciplinary problem solving.  This year’s 
judges remarked that the quality of the modeling and 
presentation in the papers was extremely high, making it 
difficult to select just ten Outstanding papers. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 21st annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 644 
teams representing institutions from 10 countries participated in 
the contest. Ten teams from the following nine institutions were 
designated as OUTSTANDING: 
 
 Duke University, Durham, NC 
 Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 
 Harvey Mudd College, Claremont CA 
 Mass Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 
 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY  
 University of California, Berkley, CA (2 Teams) 
 University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 
 University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada 
 University of Washington, Seattle, WA 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 3rd to 
Monday, February 7th, 2005.  During that time, teams of up to 
three undergraduate or high school students researched, 
modeled, and submitted a solution to one of two modeling 
problems. The contest is primarily an online contest. Teams 
register, obtain contest materials, and download the problems 
and data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM 
Website.  
 
This year, the two MCM problems were particularly 
challenging.  Problem A asked teams to develop a model 
showing the consequences of a massive dam failure. Problem 
 
 
To obtain additional information about the MCM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the MCM 
Website at:  www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm, or contact COMAP at: mcm@comap.com. 
 
Major  funding for  the MCM  is provided by a grant  from  the National Security Agency and support  from COMAP. Additional support 
is  provided  by  the  Institute  for Operations Research  and  the Management  Sciences  (INFORMS). COMAP's Mathematical Contest  in 
Modeling  and  Interdisciplinary Contest  in Modeling  are unique  among modeling  competitions  in  that  they  are  the only  international 
contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP 
uses  mathematical  tools  to  explore  real-world  problems.  It  serves  the  educational  community  as  well  as  the  world  of  work  by 
preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers. 
 

664 teams participated  
10 high school teams (2%) 
249 U.S. Teams (37%)  
415 Foreign Teams (63%) from Canada, China, Finland,
