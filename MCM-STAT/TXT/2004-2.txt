2004 ICM Statistics 
 

the problem, computer scientist Daniel Ragsdale, was a member 
of the panel of final judges.  The other author was Ron Dodge.  
The problem originated from their research on the challenges 
faced by organizations over the security of their networks and 
information systems.  The four Outstanding solution papers will 
be published in The UMAP Journal, along with commentary 
from the authors and other judges.  All 143 of the competing 
teams are to be congratulated for their excellent work and 
enthusiasm for scientific and mathematical modeling and 
interdisciplinary problem solving.  This year’s judges remarked 
that the quality of the modeling and presentation in the papers 
was extremely high, making it difficult to select just four 
Outstanding papers. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 6th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year, 143 
teams representing institutions from 5 countries participated in 
the contest.  Four teams from the following three institutions 
were designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
  
  Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA (2 teams) 
  United States Military Academy, West Point, NY 
  University of Electronic Science and Technology,  
Chengdu, China 
 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 5 to Monday, 
February 9, 2004.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to an open-ended interdisciplinary 
modeling problem. The 2004 ICM was primarily an online 
contest. Teams registered, obtained contest materials, and 
downloaded the problem and data at the prescribed time 
through COMAP’s ICM Website (Problem C of the 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling).  
 
This year’s information technology security problem was 
particularly challenging.  It involved optimizing security 
measures for academic and business information systems.  The 
problem contained various scenarios to be analyzed, had several 
challenging requirements needing scientific and mathematical 
analysis, and also had the ever-present requirements in the ICM 
to use thorough data analysis, creativity, approximation, 
precision, and effective communication.  One of the authors of 
 
ICM is an extension of COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend.  ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills as well as competence in written communication.  The first 
four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from mathematics, environmental science, environmental engineering, biology, 
chemistry, and/or resource management.  Last year’s ICM problem began a shift to operations research, information science, and 
interdisciplinary issues in security and safety, which will continue for another year (in the 2005 contest).  Each team is expected to 
have advisors and team members who represent a range of disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling. 
 
To obtain additional information about the ICM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the ICM Website 
at:  www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/icm, or contact COMAP at: icm@comap.com. 
 
Major  start-up  funding  for  the  ICM  was  provided  by  a  grant  from  the  National  Science  Foundation  (through  Project  INTERMATH) 
and COMAP. Additional support is provided by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS). The 
research  that  motivated  this  year’s  problem  was  supported  by  the  Office  of  Artificial  Intelligence  Analysis  and  Evaluation  at  the 
United States Military Academy.  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique 
among  modeling  competitions  in  that  they  are  the  only  international  contests  in  which  students  work  in  teams  to  find  a  solution. 
Centering  its educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses mathematical  tools  to explore real-world problems.  It 
serves  the  educational  community  as  well  as  the  world  of  work  by  preparing  students  to  become  better  informed—and  prepared—
citizens, consumers, and workers.
