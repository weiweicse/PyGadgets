2010 Mathematical Contest in Modeling 
Press Release—April 1, 2010 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 26th annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 2254 teams 
representing institutions from fourteen countries participated in the 
contest. Nine teams from the following institutions were designated 
as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA 
 
 
Huazhong University of Science and Tech, Wuhan, China 
Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 
Tufts University, Medford, MA 
University of Colorado - Boulder,  Boulder, CO 
University of Washington, Seattle, WA 
USMA, West Point, NY 
Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 18 to Monday, 
February 22, 2010.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 2010 
MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, obtained 
contest materials, and downloaded the problem and data at the 
prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year the two MCM problems represented significant 
challenges.  The author of Problem A, Michael Tortorella of 
Rutgers University, was also one of the final judges.  His problem, 
“The Sweet Spot” noted that every hitter knows that there is a spot 
on the fat part of a baseball bat where maximum power is 
transferred to the ball when hit. Why isn’t this spot at the end of the 
bat? A simple explanation based on torque might seem to identify 
the end of the bat as the sweet spot, but this is known to be 
empirically incorrect. Develop a model that helps explain this 
empirical finding. Also, some players believe that “corking” a bat 
(hollowing out a cylinder in the head of the bat and filling it with 
cork or rubber, then replacing a wood cap) enhances the “sweet 
spot” effect. Augment your model to confirm or deny this effect. 
Does this explain why Major League Baseball prohibits “corking”? 
Does the material out of which the bat is constructed matter? That 
is, does this model predict different behavior for wood (usually ash)

or metal (usually aluminum) bats? Is this why Major League 
Baseball prohibits metal bats? 
 
The Problem B, “Criminology” was written by Michael O’Leary of 
Towson University and Kelly Black of Clarkson University who 
were also final judges.  It states that your team has been asked by a 
local police agency to develop a method to aid in their 
investigations of serial criminals. The approach that you develop 
should make use of at least two different schemes to generate a 
geographical profile. You should develop a technique to combine 
the results of the different schemes and generate a useful prediction 
for law enforcement officers. The prediction should provide some 
kind of estimate or guidance about possible locations of the next 
crime based on the time and locations of the past crime scenes. If 
you make use of any other evidence in your estimate, you must 
provide specific details about how you incorporate the extra 
information. Your method should also provide some kind of 
estimate about how reliable the estimate will be in a given situation, 
including appropriate warnings. 
The nine Outstanding solution papers will be published in The 
UMAP Journal, along with commentary from the authors and other 
judges. All 2254 of the competing teams are to be congratulated for 
their excellent work and enthusiasm for mathematical modeling and 
interdisciplinary problem solving.

Major  funding  for  the  MCM  is  provided  by  COMAP.  Additional  support  is  provided  by  the  Institute  for  Operations  Research  and  the  Management  Sciences 
(INFORMS),  Two  Sigma  Investments,  Jane  Street  Capital  and  Department  of  Defense  Analysis,  Naval  Postgraduate  School.  COMAP's  Mathematical  Contest  in 
Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling competitions in that they are the only international contests in which students work in 
teams  to  find  a  solution.  Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on  mathematical  modeling,  COMAP  uses  mathematical  tools  to  explore  real-world  problems.  It  serves 
the educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
