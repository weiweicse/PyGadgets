the “energy” consequences of the cell phone revolution. Cell phone 
usage is mushrooming and many people are using cell phones and 
giving up their landlines. What is the consequence of this in terms 
of electricity use? Every cell phone comes with a battery and a 
recharger. The analysis should take into account the need for 
charging the batteries of the cell phones as well as the fact that cell 
phones last much less time (they get lost and break) than phones for 
landlines. Students were also asked to consider a second “Pseudo 
US,” a country of about 300 million people with about the same 
economic status as the current US. However, this emerging country 
has neither landlines nor cell phones. What is the optimal way of 
providing phone service to this country from an energy perspective?  
 
Finally, consider population and economic growth over the next 50 
years.  How will a typical Pseudo US grow?  How many Pseudo 
USs will emerge as countries prosper economically?  Each 10 years 
for the next 50 years, predict the energy needs for providing phone 
service based upon your previous analysis.  Assume all countries 
provide electricity from oil.  Interpret your predictions in term of 
barrels of oil. 
The nine Outstanding solution papers will be published in The 
UMAP Journal, along with commentary from the authors and other 
judges. All 1675 of the competing teams are to be congratulated for 
their excellent work and enthusiasm for mathematical modeling and 
interdisciplinary problem solving.   
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 25th annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 1675 teams 
representing institutions from fourteen countries participated in the 
contest. Nine teams from the following eight institutions were 
designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY 
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 
Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 
 
Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA 
Southwestern University, Georgetown, TX 
The College of Idaho, Caldwell, ID 
Tsinghua University, Beijing, China 
University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 
University of Delaware, Newark, DE 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 5 to Monday, 
February 9, 2009.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 2009 
MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, obtained 
contest materials, and downloaded the problem and data at the 
prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year the two MCM problems represented significant 
challenges.  The author of Problem A, Danny Solow of Case 
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH was also one of the 
final judges.  His problem, “Designing a Traffic Circle,” noted that 
many cities have traffic circles, from large ones with many lanes in 
the circle (such as at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and the Victory 
Monument in Bangkok) to small ones with one or two lanes in the 
circle. Some of these traffic circles have a stop sign or a yield sign 
on every incoming road that gives priority to traffic already in the 
circle; some have a yield sign in the circle at each incoming road 
that gives priority to incoming traffic; and some have a traffic light 
on each incoming road (with no right turn allowed on a red light). 
The goal of the problem is to use a model to determine how best to 
control traffic flow in, around, and out of a circle, clearly stating the 
objective(s) used in the model and summarizing the conditions 
under which each type of traffic-control method should be used. 
The Problem B, “Energy and the Cell Phone” was written by Joe 
Malkevitch of York College in Jamaica, NY. This question involves

Major  funding  for  the  MCM  is  provided  by  COMAP.  Additional  support  is  provided  by  the  Institute  for  Operations  Research  and  the  Management  Sciences 
(INFORMS),  Two  Sigma  Investments  and  Jane  Street  Capital.  COMAP's  Mathematical  Contest  in  Modeling  and  Interdisciplinary  Contest  in  Modeling  are  unique 
among modeling competitions in that they are the only international contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its educational philosophy on 
mathematical  modeling,  COMAP  uses  mathematical  tools  to  explore  real-world  problems.  It  serves  the  educational  community  as  well  as  the  world  of  work  by 
preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
