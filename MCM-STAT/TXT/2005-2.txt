2005 ICM Statistics 
 

Campbell, editor of The UMAP Journal and Professor of 
Mathematics and Computer Science at Beloit College, and 
geoscientist and civil engineer Ted Hromadka, who served on 
the panel of final judges.  The problem originated from their 
research and interest in resource management.  The three 
Outstanding solution papers will be published in The UMAP 
Journal, along with commentary from both Dr. Campbell and 
Dr. Hromadka.  All the members of the 164 competing teams 
are to be congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm 
for scientific and mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary 
problem solving.  This year’s judges remarked that despite the 
challenging problem, the quality of the modeling, analysis, and 
presentation was high. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 7th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year, 164 
teams representing institutions from 4 countries participated in 
the contest.  Three teams from the following institutions were 
designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
  
Olin College of Engineering, Needham, MA 
East China University of Science and Technology,  
 
Shanghai City, China 
Maggie Walker Governor’s School, Richmond, VA 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 3 to Monday, 
February 7, 2005.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, analyzed, 
modeled, and communicated a solution to an open-ended 
interdisciplinary modeling problem. The 2005 ICM was 
primarily an on-line contest, where teams registered, obtained 
contest materials, and downloaded the problem statement at the 
prescribed time through COMAP’s ICM Website.  
 
This year’s nonrenewable resource problem was particularly 
challenging.  It required teams to select a nonrenewable or 
exhaustible resource and model its depletion over time.  The 
problem contained issues such as economic, demographic, 
political, environmental, security, and future technology to be 
analyzed, had several challenging requirements needing 
scientific and mathematical analysis, and also had the ever-
present requirements in the ICM to use thorough data analysis, 
creativity, approximation, precision, and effective 
communication.  The authors of the problem were Paul 
 
ICM is an extension of COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend.  ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills as well as competence in written communication.  The first 
four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from environmental science, environmental engineering, biology, chemistry, and/or 
resource management.  The last three ICM problems involved operations research, information science, environmental science, and 
interdisciplinary issues in security and safety.  Each team is expected to have advisors and team members who represent a range of 
disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling.  Next year, the ICM problem will involve modeling in the area of 
public health.

Major start-up funding for the ICM was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (through Project INTERMATH) 
and COMAP. Additional support is provided by The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS).  
COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling competitions in 
that they are the only international contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its educational philosophy 
on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses mathematical tools to explore real-world problems. It serves the educational community as 
well as the world of work by preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
