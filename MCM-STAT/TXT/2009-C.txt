This problem also had the ever-present ICM requirements to 
use thorough data analysis, creativity, approximation and 
precision, along with effective communication. The author of 
the problem was Melissa Garren, Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography, CA. The problem originated from her own 
professional research. 
 
The Two Outstanding solution papers will be published in The 
UMAP Journal, along with commentaries from the problem 
author and judges. All the members of the 374 competing teams 
are to be congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm 
for scientific and mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary 
problem solving. This year’s judges remarked that despite the 
challenging problem with myriad difficult tasks, the quality of 
the modeling, analysis, and presentation was high. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 11th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year, a 
record 374 teams representing institutions from four countries 
participated in the contest. Two teams were designated as 
OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
  
United States Military Academy, West Point, NY  
China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 
China (INFORMS Prize) 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 5 to Monday, 
February 9, 2009. During that time, teams of three students 
researched, analyzed, modeled, and communicated a solution to 
an open-ended interdisciplinary modeling problem. The 2009 
ICM was primarily an online contest, where teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem 
statement and data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s 
ICM Website.  
 
This year’s environmental sciences problem was extremely 
complex and challenging. It required teams to understand 
water-quality issues, biodiversity of coral reefs, and marine 
ecological relationships to build effective models to compare 
complex aquaculture networks. The problem contained many 
complex and multifaceted issues to be analyzed and had several 
challenging requirements for innovative scientific and 
mathematical modeling and analysis.  
 
 
 
 
ICM is associated with COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend. ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), 
as well as competence in written communication. The first four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from environmental 
science, biology, chemistry, and/or resource management. The next three ICM problems involved operations research, information 
science, environmental science, and interdisciplinary issues in security and safety. The next three contest problems involved public 
health. This year’s problem returned to the environmental area.  Each team is expected to include advisors and team members who 
represent a range of disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling. 
 
To obtain additional information about the ICM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the ICM 
Website at: www.mcmcontest.com, or contact COMAP at: mcm@comap.com 
 
Major start-up funding for the ICM was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (through Project INTERMATH) 
and COMAP. Additional support is provided by The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) 
and IBM.  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling 
competitions in that they are the only international contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its 
educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses mathematical tools to explore real-world problems. It serves the 
educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, 
consumers, workers, and community leaders. 
 

374 teams participated
