2007 Mathematical Contest in Modeling 
Press Release—March 21, 2007 

“fairly” and “simply” determining congressional districts for a 
state. Problem B, written by Professor Paul Campbell of Beloit 
College, required teams to devise and compare procedures for 
boarding and deboarding planes with varying sizes from 85 to 
800. Teams selecting this problem were also required to write 
an executive summary not to exceed two pages in which they 
set out their conclusions to an audience of airline executives, 
gate agents, and flight crews. 
 
The fourteen Outstanding solution papers will be published in 
The UMAP Journal, along with commentary from the authors 
and other judges.  All 949 of the competing teams are to be 
congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm for 
mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary problem solving.   
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 23rd annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 949 
teams representing institutions from 12 countries participated in 
the contest. Fourteen teams from the following eleven 
institutions were designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Duke University, Durham, NC (3 Teams) 
Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 
MIT, Cambridge, MA 
National University of Defense Technology, China  
National University of Singapore, Singapore 
 
School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, China  
Slippery Rock University, Slippery Rock, PA 
Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 
University of Puget Sound, Tacoma, WA 
University of Stellenbosch, South Africa 
University of Washington, Seattle, WA (2 Teams) 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 8 to Monday, 
February 12, 2007.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 
2007 MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem and 
data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year, the two MCM problems represented significant 
challenges in their own right. The author of Problem A, 
Professor Michael Tortorella of Rutgers University was also a 
member of the panel of final judges. Problem A, The 
Gerrymandering Problem, asked teams to develop a model for

Major  funding  for  the MCM  is provided by COMAP. Additional support  is provided by  the  Institute  for Operations Research and  the 
Management Sciences  (INFORMS),  and Two Sigma  Investments. COMAP's Mathematical Contest  in Modeling and  Interdisciplinary 
Contest  in Modeling are unique among modeling competitions  in  that  they are  the only  international contests  in which  students work 
in  teams  to  find  a  solution.  Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on  mathematical  modeling,  COMAP  uses  mathematical  tools  to 
explore real-world problems. It serves the educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better 
informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers. 
 

949 teams participated 
13 high school teams (1%) 
283 U.S. Teams (30%) 
666 Foreign Teams (70%) from Australia, Canada,  China, 
Finland, Indonesia, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand,
