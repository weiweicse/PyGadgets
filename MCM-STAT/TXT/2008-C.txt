This problem also had the ever-present ICM requirements to 
use thorough data analysis, creativity, approximation and 
precision, along with effective communication. The author of 
the problem was Kathleen Crowley, College of Saint Rose, NY. 
The problem originated from her interest in understanding 
health care. 
 
 The Three Outstanding solution papers will be published in 
The UMAP Journal, along with commentaries from the 
problem author and judges. All the members of the 380 
competing teams are to be congratulated for their excellent 
work and enthusiasm for scientific and mathematical modeling 
and interdisciplinary problem solving. This year’s judges 
remarked that despite the challenging problem with myriad 
difficult tasks, the quality of the modeling, analysis, and 
presentation was high. 
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 10th annual 
Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). This year, a 
record 380 teams representing institutions from three countries 
participated in the contest. Three teams were designated as 
OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
  
Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA  
National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 
China (INFORMS Prize) 
Beijing University of Posts and Telecom, Beijing, China 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 14 to Monday, 
February 18, 2008. During that time, teams of three students 
researched, analyzed, modeled, and communicated a solution to 
an open-ended interdisciplinary modeling problem. The 2008 
ICM was primarily an online contest, where teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem 
statement and data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s 
ICM Website.  
 
This year’s health care system problem was extremely complex 
and challenging. It required teams to understand the issues and 
finances of health care systems and to build effective metrics to 
measure and compare health care system quality. The problem 
contained many issues to be analyzed, such as financial, social, 
cultural, psychological, and ethical, to be analyzed, and had 
several challenging requirements for innovative scientific and 
mathematical modeling and analysis.  
 
 
 
ICM is associated with COMAP’s Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), which is held during the same weekend. ICM is 
designed to develop and advance interdisciplinary problem-solving skills in science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), 
as well as competence in written communication. The first four interdisciplinary problems involved concepts from environmental 
science, environmental engineering, biology, chemistry, and/or resource management. The next three ICM problems involved 
operations research, information science, environmental science, and interdisciplinary issues in security and safety. This is the third 
contest problem involving public health. Each team is expected to include advisors and team members who represent a range of 
disciplinary interests in applied problem solving and modeling. Next year, the ICM problem will return to an environmental science 
theme.  
 
To obtain additional information about the ICM and to obtain a complete listing of all team designations, please visit the ICM 
Website at: www.mcmcontest.com, or contact COMAP at: mcm@comap.com 
 
Major start-up funding for the ICM was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (through Project INTERMATH) 
and COMAP. Additional support is provided by The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) 
and IBM.  COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling and Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling are unique among modeling 
competitions in that they are the only international contests in which students work in teams to find a solution. Centering its 
educational philosophy on mathematical modeling, COMAP uses mathematical tools to explore real-world problems. It serves the 
educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better informed—and prepared—citizens, 
consumers, workers, and community leaders.
