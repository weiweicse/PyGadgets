2011 Mathematical Contest in Modeling® 
communicate with one another in situations where direct user‐
Press Release—April 15, 2011 
to‐user contact would not be possible. However, repeaters can 
interfere with one another unless they are far enough apart or 
transmit on sufficiently separated frequencies.  
 For a circular flat area of 40 miles radius, contestants were 
required to determine the minimum number of repeaters 
necessary to accommodate 1,000 simultaneous users, assuming 
that the spectrum available is 145 to 148 MHz, the transmitter 
frequency in a repeater is either 600 kHz above or 600 kHz 
below the receiver frequency, and there are 54 different "PL" 
tones available to reduce the potential of interference. Then, 
contestants were required to determine how their solution 
changes if there are 10,000 users.  And finally, they were 
required to discuss the case where there might be defects in 
line‐of‐sight propagation caused by mountainous areas. 
 
The eight Outstanding solution papers will be published in The 
UMAP Journal, along with commentary from the authors and other 
judges. All 2775 of the competing teams are to be congratulated for 
their excellent work and enthusiasm for mathematical modeling and 
interdisciplinary problem solving.   
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 27th annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 2775 teams 
representing institutions from sixteen countries participated in the 
contest. Eight teams from the following institutions were designated 
as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Eastern Oregon University, La Grande, OR 
Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA 
Peking University, Beijing, China  
 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 
Tsinghua University, Beijing, China 
University of Electronic Science and Tech., Chengdu, China 
University of Western Ontario, London, Canada 
Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 10 to Monday, 
February 14, 2011.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 2011 
MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, obtained 
contest materials, and downloaded the problem and data at the 
prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
was also a Final Judge.  The problem asked contestants to 
 
determine the shape of a snowboard course (currently known 
This year the two MCM problems represented significant 
as a “halfpipe”) to maximize the production of “vertical air” by a 
challenges.  The author or Problem A is Michael Tortorella, who 
skilled snowboarder. "Vertical air" is the maximum vertical 
distance above the edge of the halfpipe. They were also 
required to tailor the shape to optimize other possible 
requirements, such as maximum twist in the air, and to 
determine the tradeoffs that may be required to develop a 
“practical” course.  Problem B was also written by Michael 
Tortorella, and required contestants to determine the minimum 
number of "repeaters" necessary to serve different population sizes 
and environmental conditions. The VHF radio spectrum involves 
line-of-sight transmission and reception. This limitation can be 
overcome by “repeaters,” which pick up weak signals, amplify 
them, and retransmit them on a different frequency. Thus, using a

Major  funding  for  the  MCM  is  provided  by  COMAP.  Additional  support  is  provided  by  the  Institute  for  Operations  Research  and  the  Management  Sciences 
(INFORMS)  and  Two  Sigma  Investments.  COMAP's  Mathematical  Contest  in  Modeling  and  Interdisciplinary  Contest  in  Modeling  are  unique  among  modeling 
competitions  in  that  they  are  the  only  international  contests  in which  students work  in  teams  to  find  a  solution. Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on mathematical 
modeling, COMAP uses mathematical  tools  to explore real-world problems. It serves  the educational community as well as  the world of work by preparing students  to 
become better informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
