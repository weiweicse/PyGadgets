2008 Mathematical Contest in Modeling 
Press Release—April 11, 2008 

 

responses to deal with the melting. The author of Problem B, 
Veena Mendiratta, of Lucent Technologies, was also one of the 
final judges. Problem B, “Creating Sudoku Puzzles,” asked 
teams to develop an algorithm to construct Sudoku puzzles of 
varying difficulty. The problem required teams to develop 
metrics to define a difficulty level. Further, the problem 
required each team’s algorithm and metrics to be extensible to a 
varying number of difficulty levels, the algorithm to be 
illustrated with at least 4 difficulty levels, and an analysis of the 
complexity of the algorithm in the solution. 
 
The nine Outstanding solution papers will be published in The 
UMAP Journal, along with commentary from the authors and 
other judges. All 1162 of the competing teams are to be 
congratulated for their excellent work and enthusiasm for 
mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary problem solving.   
 

 
COMAP is pleased to announce the results of the 24th annual 
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM). This year, 1162 
teams representing institutions from fourteen countries 
participated in the contest. Nine teams from the following eight 
institutions were designated as OUTSTANDING WINNERS: 
 
Duke University, Durham, NC 
Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 
 
Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA (2 Teams) 
The College of Idaho, Caldwell, ID 
Youngstown State University, Youngstown, OH 
University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 
University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 
University of Delaware, Newark, DE 
 
This year’s contest ran from Thursday, February 14 to Monday, 
February 18, 2008.  During that time, teams of up to three 
undergraduate or high school students researched, modeled, and 
submitted a solution to one of two modeling problems. The 
2008 MCM was primarily an online contest. Teams registered, 
obtained contest materials, and downloaded the problem and 
data at the prescribed time through COMAP’s MCM Website.  
 
This year, the two MCM problems represented significant 
challenges. The author of Problem A, Professor Jerry Griggs 
from the University of South Carolina was also one of the final 
judges. Problem A, “Take a Bath,” asked teams to consider the 
effects on land from the melting of the North Polar Ice Cap due 
to the predicted increase in global temperatures.  Specifically, 
students were asked to model the effects on the coast of Florida 
every 10 years for the next 50 years due to the melting, with 
particular attention given to large metropolitan 
areas. Additionally, they were asked to propose appropriate

Website at: www.mcmcontest.com, or contact COMAP at: mcm@comap.com. 
 
Major  funding  for  the MCM  is provided by COMAP. Additional support  is provided by  the  Institute  for Operations Research and  the 
Management Sciences  (INFORMS),  and Two Sigma  Investments. COMAP's Mathematical Contest  in Modeling and  Interdisciplinary 
Contest  in Modeling are unique among modeling competitions  in  that  they are  the only  international contests  in which  students work 
in  teams  to  find  a  solution.  Centering  its  educational  philosophy  on  mathematical  modeling,  COMAP  uses  mathematical  tools  to 
explore real-world problems. It serves the educational community as well as the world of work by preparing students to become better 
informed—and prepared—citizens, consumers, and workers.
